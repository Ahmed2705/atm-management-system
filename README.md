- PIN verification for security
- Withdraw money with balance check
- Deposit funds
- Transfer between accounts
- Check current balance

# Technologies Used
- C++ (Standard Library)
- OOP (Classes and objects)
- Multi-file structure (`main.cpp`, `Atm.h`, `Atm.cpp`)

# How to Compile #purpose
```bash
g++ main.cpp Atm.cpp -o atm
./atm
